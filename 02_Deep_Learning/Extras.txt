More Topics to Cover:

	Understand about Network Architectures:
		1. AlexNet
		2. VGGNet/Â GoogleNet
		3. Inception Network
		4. ResNet
		5. Siamese
		6. SSD/ Yolo

	Transfer Learning can be used when:
		- We have a massive dataset in one domain and a smaller dataset in other similar domain.
		- We have a pre-trained model in one domain and a massive dataset in other similar domain
		- We have a pre-trained model in one domain and a smaller dataset in another similar domain
